## Skills developed during piscine

### Soft-Skills
	Self Learning
		In 42 piscine bootcamp self-learning is very important, because we don't 
		have acess to teachers, so the learning is focused in googling and asking
		to your colleagues.
	
	Working in groups
		During weekends we have a project called "Rush", that teams with 3 members
		are automatically generated and we have to finish the project with this 3
		members, its a great way to learn how to finish projects with a group.
