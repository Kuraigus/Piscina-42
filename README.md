# 42saopaulo's Piscine

Git repository with coding developed at the C bootcamp at 42saopaulo from 18/nov/2019 to 13/dec/2019.

## Skills developed during the piscine

### Soft-Skills
	Self-learning
		At 42saopaulo, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology.
		There are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling,
		enquiring your classmates, and empirical knowledge.

	Teamwork
		On weekends, a 24h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	Time management
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
		they want, which demands excellent time management skills for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.

### Hard-Skills
	C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42saopaulo's piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and makefile.

	Shell
		The first two days of the program are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands pisciners to
		be at ease with such a system.
