## Skills developed during piscine

### Soft-Skills
	Self Learning
		In 42 piscine bootcamp self-learning is very important, because we don't 
		have acess to teachers, so the learning is focused in googling and asking
		to your colleagues.
	
	Working in groups
		During weekends we have a project called "Rush", that teams with 3 members
		are automatically generated and we have to finish the project with this 3
		members, its a great way to learn how to finish projects with a group.

	Time management
		We need to learn how to manage our time, if we dont manage our time correctly
		we "Drown" inside the piscine.

### Hard-Skills
	C Language
		during piscine we learn a lot C, the main language its C, so we need to learn
		pointers, functions, headers.
	
	Shell
		Using macs and iTerm, we are forced to learn shell commands to finish projects
		and start new ones.
	Git
		They use a git repository to finish projects.
